# php-site-mirrors

Use php as a proxy to mirror websites.
I created this for some of my projects that needs cross-site requests.
Its uses "PHP requests libarary"

Set DOCUMENT_ROOT to [...]/public_html folder. Setup website you wanted to mirrors in index.php and all are ready to go :)

Happy PHPing!
